# Expanded Form

This is just a quick program I've created for my kids to help 
them understand how to break down numbers into their expanded
form. 

## Goal
When my kids are doing their homework I would like them to check
their math work via a very simple web page when they can enter
an number and get back the expanded form of the number in base
10. So if they enter:

``` 243 ```

They would receive back as an answer

``` 2 100s + 4 10s + 3 1s ```
